<h1>About Me!</h1>
<div>
    <p>My name is Charlie and i am a British shorthair. I am one years old and i am married and the father of 3 kittens! I would say i demand attention quite a lot but when you are as perfect as me you for sure will always get your way. I used to be a really shy kitten and never really liked being around anyone but as i grew older i realised how i have friends around me that love me very much. Im rarely ever home because im out there in my neighbours house eating their food but thats okay everyone on my street loves me so they give me all the food they have!</p>

<h2>A picture that can cure sadness</h2>
<p>This is my best friend in the world called Naz holding my son. I always feel so safe and calm around her. Im always sleeping on her bed like its mine but i dont think she cares because she loves me too much.</p>
